1) A service that reads commands from a file and displays them in the correct sequence. The commands in the file are the solution to the problem:
a) Create the jd2_homework3-4 database
b) Create a film table
c) The film has a name, duration (let it be 60, 90 or 120 for simplicity minutes), ticket price
d) Create 5 arbitrary entries in this table
e) Find the maximum price among all films
f)  Remove movie with minimum price
g) Replace the name of the movie with the highest price with “Hot film!”
h) Delete the film table
i)  Delete jd2_homework3-4 database

2)  A service that performs the following items using java (previously, the database should have a jd2_homework3-4 database and a car table):
a) Adds 10 arbitrary records to table car with fields name (String), carModel (Enum with three value objects), engineСapacity (int in the range 1-10) in within one transaction
b) Displays from the DATABASE a list of machines with fields name, carModel, engineСapacity, in which engineСapacity has some arbitrary value within single transaction
c) Deletes records from the table with the minimum engineСapacity within one transactions
d) Displays from the DATABASE the number of records for which engineСapacity some arbitrary value
e) Replace title for machines with arbitrary engineCapacity with “Good capacity” and print result on screen in one transaction
